# binary_search_tree
For the purposes of this challenge, we define a binary search tree to be a binary tree with the following properties:  The data value of every node in a node's left subtree is less than the data value of that node. The data value of every node in a node's right subtree is greater than the data value of that node. The data value of every node is distinct.
